# Signos

## Project Overview
Signos is an interactive retro-styled game designed to teach people American Sign Language (ASL). Using an Ultraleap Leap Motion Controller, the software tracks hand gestures and compares them to pre-trained models to improve accuracy when learning signs.

## Game Modes
Signos features two modes for practicing sign language: Learn Mode and Speed Practice. Learn Mode is designed to train a user's accuracy with signs. Users initially view an animation that demonstrates the sign to learn. After viewing the demonstration, the user can practice with a progress bar that maps their progress towards accurately making the sign. The other game mode is Speed Practice, which is designed to improve a user's speed in communicating in sign language.

## In-Progress Features
* Add additional letters for Learn mode
* Implement Speed Practice mode
* Improve recording for more complex signs
